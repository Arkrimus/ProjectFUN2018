# ProjectFUN - 2018 Spacial Void
A project in which 4 team members work together to create a game within a month time period.


## Project: Spacial Void
The game created is titled Spacial Void, a space-themed shooter with inspiration taken from Asteroids and Galaga, and implemented in a new style using [ZeroEngine](Zeroengine.io)
A video of the game during ProjectFUN2018's final showcase is shown in this [video](https://youtu.be/hM4-Hil-oZE?t=608).

## How do you play?
Spacial Void is a single-level twin-stick shooter with the twist of interdimensional travel. Fly around the cosmos, avoiding and destroying alien ships and creatures trying to destroy your ship! If you find yourself cornered by too many enemies, activating your dimensional travel drive can save you from total annihilation. Heal up and reposition to come back from the dark and mysterious dimension with a new attitude for your enemies to enjoy!

## Running and Playing
Spacial Void was build using zero engine. Currently there is an issue with the ZeroEngine download link on their wiki page, so building and running is not currently an option. Downloading and running SpacialVoid.exe will allow you to run and play the game. Windows defender may notify you that the executable can cause damage to the device, but simply do More Info->Run Anyway, and the game should run properly.
